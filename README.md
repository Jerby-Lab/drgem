# DR-GEM: Distributionally Robust and latent Group-awarE consensus Machine learning for single cell genomics

DR-GEM is a  self-supervised meta-algorithm that combines principles in distributionally robust optimization with balanced consensus machine learning to overcome the challenges of latent class imbalance in analysis pipelines featuring dimensionality reduction and clustering.

# **Quick start**

To install DR-GEM you can eiher run: 
`devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/Jerby-Lab/drgem")` or you can download all the files in this R package and use: 
`devtools::install("drgem")`

We have provided a tutorial that will be available via the following link when the repository is made public:
[DR-GEM tutorial on tubo-ovarian cancer spatial transcriptomics dataset](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Jerby-Lab/drgem/blob/main/vignettes/tutorial_tubo-ovarian.html) or you can download the file in `vignettes/tutorial_tubo-ovarian.html` and view in any web browswer.
