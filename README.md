# DR-GEM: Distributionally Robust and latent Group-awarE consensus Machine learning for single cell genomics

DR-GEM is a  self-supervised meta-algorithm that combines principles in distributionally robust optimization with balanced consensus machine learning to overcome the challenges of latent class imbalance in analysis pipelines featuring dimensionality reduction and clustering.

# **Quick start**

To install DR-GEM you can eiher run: 
`devtools::install_github(repo = "https://github.com/Jerby-Lab/drgem")`

or download the compressed R package and use: 
`devtools::install("drgem")`
